QUEUE VIEW:

The QueueView is designed to provide a standard unidirectional 
queue interface to an underlying std::list<T> of objects. 

This is meant to encapsulate the idea of multiple consumers
wanting to consume "all new" data of a queue without 
it mattering:
   1. when they connected to the queue. That is, the queueview contains its
      own internal state position data
   2. abstracting away some fo the operations like pop, etc.
