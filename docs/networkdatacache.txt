The network data cache is the cache of all received network data. 

It presents queueview-like interfaces for the data

This isn't a "real" source in that it doesn't inherit from Element; instead
it can be viewed as a single historical cache of all of the relevant
data that's come over the wire, also worrying about caching and the like. 

We have a "getQueueView" that returns a queueview for a particular
set of data.
