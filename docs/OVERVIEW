Streams is an application for viewing continuous-time data. 

data/
   Buffers are data buffers that are passed around. Not
   required to implement any particular interface

sources/ 
   stream sources that can provide data. Generally require access
   to either the network, time, or audio objects. 

   Required to implement the StreamSource<T> interface, which
   provides getQueueView() to access the underlying data buffer, 
   as well as invalidate() and newData() signals. 

   Current sources: 
      NoiseWave -- fake data source

filters/ 
   Technically stream sources, but can be combined / linked to
   previous stream sources

   Also required to implement the StreamSource<T> interface, where
   T is the output datatype. 

vis/ 
   classes for visualizing a class of data. 
  
   required to implement the StreamRenderer and TriggerRenderer interfaces. 

   Current vis: 
      SineVis: A test vis. always plots a sine wave, regardless of input
      WaveVis: primary continuous-time waveform viewer
      SpectVis: spectrogram viewer
      
	    
triggers/ 
   Classes that are required to imlement the TriggerSource interface
      	

Other classes:

streamwin: main stream window

Both work by querying a given vis element as to its size in pixels
and then performing a coordinate transform such that zero is in
the center of that element

triggerwin: main trigger window
