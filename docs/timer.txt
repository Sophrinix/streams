The timer is complex as there are several times it needs to be aware of: 

somatime: the time it reads from the network
walltime: seconds since epoch
experiment time: time since some arbitrary starting point
streamtime: seconds since the program started, used for internal math, display, etc. 


Timer can run in a "fake" mode, but in general it takes
in a pointer to a netcodec and queries it for time, and
then gets newtimestamps from the network codec
