Timing ticks are an interesting challenge -- they need to be visible
when you need them, and at the same time out of the way when you
don't, so as to not obscure data. 

We're looking at data over seven orders of temporal magnitude. In each
case, it's going to be a little difficult to understand what our temporal sale is. 

I propose the following temporal conventions:

1. ticks are at the following resolutions: 

10 ms
100 ms
1 sec
10 sec
1 min
10 min
1 hour

2. There are "major" ticks and "minor" ticks. There is always at least
   one major tick visible on the screen at a given time. As we
   transition from one tick regime to another, the old ticks should
   fade out and the new ones should become visible.

3. only the "major" ticks should have their time indicated

given a time window, [T1_, T2_] we should be able to compute the time range.
