Observations: 

Let Sources and Vises be elements of a graph; the graph is independent
of the GUI that controls it

Note that sources will always need varying access to object internals for 
configuraiton and manipulation. The big examples here are: 
   Objects which read NetworkData will need access to the network
	data object
   Objects which read NetworkEvent will need access to the network
	event object
   Objects which read files might like access, but won't really need it


So when you say CreateObjectType(X)


VisControl() has its own internal mainwin/triggerwin signals which aggregate
the internal signals

then WaveWin() queries VisControl
