What do we want from waveform visualization? 

We'd like to be able to look at 12+ waveforms on a single 1600x1200 screen

Some sort of specgram visualization? 

history, history, history -- but how to -use- that

In some sense, the chronic visualization app is different from the short-term app

How to trigger? How to interface with those triggers? 

Ideally we have triggers across the data and it's easy to do things like "show me time-averaged waveform across all channels", etc. 

On one level, we really want just a single app per channel. 

Assume 2 kHz sampling rate for continuous data, we're looking at 30 MB/hr, or 8 kB/sec (per channel). that's 1.8 GB ram/hour

at start-up we specify a history buffer size, which is 100% a function of the available ram and the sampling rate. 

user-specified triggers? do we want them yet? 

Remember, be AGILE...

There's no good way of both cross-channel triggering -and- having one waveform-per-display

Do we want to combine waves and freqs? I mean, sure, but... NO, totally different temporal scales

vis filtering: 

I think the best way to populate / compute our filtering options is
simply with an external file of options, that links into libdsp, and
names the filters.

So for example

<theta> <fir> <params> </ > 

etc. 

How do we handle the "we just updated the scene, now we need to churn"
problem? Continuations! Or... something not quite so complex.
