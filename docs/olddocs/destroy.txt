Because the pointers are shared, we would set them to zero generally

The object is guaranteed to be valid for the duration of
the destroyed() callback, but not after. 

Since in destroy() everyone will disclaim their pointers, we should 
then have the reference count drop to zero, and be DELETED. 

For GUI elements, remember that they generally have a naked pointer to
the object; thus they need to be sure to properly modify their
internal state when receiving the deleted signals.
